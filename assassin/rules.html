    <hr>

    </ul>
    <p>To be entered you must have turned money in by <b>March 28th</b>. No exceptions. All updates to be shared through instagram and website but nowhere else.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Weapons</h2>
    <p>All guns must be Nerf brand and fire a foam dart with a rubber tip or foam ball. You may not use an automatic Nerf gun or modify ammo. All kills must be done with a gun. Throwing the ammo will not count.</p>
    <p>Any violations will result in being banned from the game.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Assassinations</h2>
    <p>They will only be valid if the ammo hits your target. Initial targets will be randomized and <b>given on Sunday, March 30th</b>. You will only be going after one target. All targets must be assassinated by the end of the week. If you assassinate your target, you will inherit their target. If a target shoots an assassin first, they are safe until midnight of that day, then subject to purges.</p>
    <p>When you legally assassinate someone, dm the Instagram. Confirmation must come from both target and killer. Any evidence (picture/video) must clearly show the target being eliminated. An assassination will not be confirmed until the target also admits defeat. It's up to you to make that happen.</p>
    <p>If you do not assassinate your target at the end of the week, you will be eliminated from the game.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Purges</h2>
    <p>There will be random purge days. During these days, safe items will not count. The purge will be announced on Instagram the day before:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span id="blue">Code blue</span>: Water guns will be the only way to kill a target. No balloons, hoses or water bottles.</li>
      <li><span id="red">Code red</span>: Shoot a target that killed their assassin. If killer was previously eliminated that week, they will be back in.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Safe Items</h2>
    <p>If worn, a target cannot be eliminated but may also not assassinate another player. Safe items are limited to a one mile radius around Roosevelt. (See <a href="zones.html">safe zones</a> for more info.) Safe items are limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Goggles - must be worn on the face</li>
      <li>Swim Cap - must be worn on the head</li>
      <li>Water Wings - must be worn on arms above the elbow</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Off Limits</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>No assassinations on school grounds including the parking lot or during school sanctioned events. This includes practices, games and performances held by any school.</li>
      <li>You may not assassinate anyone in their workplace. Walking to and from is fair game. The same applies for any volunteering.</li>
      <li>You may not assassinate anyone in places of worship. Parking lots are okay.</li>
      <li>Should you be caught trespassing (in someone's home or any other place) and someone tells you to leave, you must. Otherwise, you will be eliminated. This means you must completely leave the property. You may only eliminate someone in their home if they or someone else who lives there invite you inside.</li>
      <li>Cars must be off for a kill to count. If the killer is in the car, target is in a car, or they are both in a car, it must be off. You may not shoot through a car window or sunroof at any time. Should you cause any damage to a car, you will be eliminated.</li>
    </ol>
